## Implementation in TGV Times Dashboard

### Provider Filter Updated
The dashboard now includes the following high-speed providers in the filter dropdown:

1. **All** (Default - shows all high-speed trains)
2. **TGV INOUI** - Standard SNCF service
3. **OUIGO** - Low-cost SNCF option
4. **TGV Lyria** - France-Switzerland service ‚ú® NEW
5. **Eurostar** - France-UK service ‚ú® NEW
6. **DB SNCF** - Germany-France service
7. **Trenitalia** - Italian high-speed trains (not yet found in API)
8. **Renfe** - Spanish high-speed trains (not yet found in API)

### New Stations Added
The following international stations have been added to `stations.json`:

**France:**
- Paris Gare de l'Est (to Metz)
- Metz
- Paris Gare du Nord (to London)

**International:**
- London St Pancras (UK) üá¨üáß

Each station now includes a `country` field (`FR` for France, `GB` for UK).

### Feature Enhancements

1. **French Stations Only for Departure**: The departure station dropdown now only shows French stations, preventing users from selecting international stations as origin points.

2. **Sort Options**: Added the ability to sort results by:
   - Departure Time (default)
   - Arrival Time

## Technical Notes

### Station ID Patterns
- **French stations (SNCF)**: `stop_area:SNCF:XXXXXXXX`
- **Swiss stations (in Navitia)**: `stop_area:SNCF:XXXXXXXX` (mapped to SNCF coverage)
- **UK stations**: `stop_area:SNCF:XXXXXXXX` (Eurostar terminals in SNCF coverage)

### API Coverage Limitations
The Navitia SNCF API appears to have limited coverage for:
- Italian destinations (Milan, Turin)
- Spanish destinations
- German destinations (some DB ICE routes may be included via DB SNCF partnership)

### Physical Mode Detection
The filter uses `physical_mode` to identify high-speed trains:
- French: `"Train grande vitesse"`
- English: `"high speed"`

This approach automatically includes any high-speed operator without needing to explicitly list brand names.

## Search Methodology

### Scripts Used
1. **`search_international_operators.py`**: Main search script that tested 28 route combinations between Paris/Lyon and Swiss/Italian cities
2. **`check_eurostar.py`**: Specific script to verify Eurostar availability
3. **`get_station_ids.py`**: Utility to find Navitia station IDs for international cities

### Routes Tested
- Paris Gare de Lyon ‚Üî Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich, Basel, Milan, Turin
- Lyon Part-Dieu ‚Üî Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich, Basel, Milan, Turin
- Paris Gare du Nord ‚Üí London St Pancras

## Future Considerations

1. **Frecciarossa Monitoring**: Keep checking for Frecciarossa availability as the Paris-Milan service may be added to Navitia coverage in the future.

2. **Additional Swiss Routes**: Consider adding more Swiss cities like Bern, Lucerne, or Brig which may also be served by TGV Lyria.

3. **Belgian Routes**: Investigate Thalys/Eurostar routes to Brussels, which may be available in the API.

4. **German Routes**: Check for TGV/ICE services to German cities like Frankfurt, Stuttgart, or Munich via DB SNCF partnership.

5. **Spanish Routes**: Monitor for Renfe-SNCF cooperation routes (Barcelona-Paris, Madrid-Paris).

## Conclusion

The Navitia SNCF API successfully provides data for:
- ‚úÖ TGV Lyria (Switzerland)
- ‚úÖ Eurostar (United Kingdom)
- ‚ùå Frecciarossa (Italy) - Not yet available

The TGV Times dashboard has been updated to support these international operators with proper filtering, station management, and country-based restrictions.
